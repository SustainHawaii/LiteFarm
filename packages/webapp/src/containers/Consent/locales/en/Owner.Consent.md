Grow uses the management information that you enter into the app to generate insights about the financial, environmental, and social benefits or impacts of your management decisions. We anonymize this data to conduct non-commercial academic research on sustainable food systems. Because this data is anonymized when used in our research, it cannot be traced to you or your farm. This data includes:

- Pest control task information: product name; amount of product applied; application target (i.e., pest or disease name), common name, scientific name, group; active ingredient name; active ingredient concentration; harvest interval; entry interval; type of control; location(s) and crop(s) targeted.

- Cleaning task information: product name; amount of product applied; application target (i.e., bins or tables), estimated water usage, location(s).

- Harvest task information: location(s) harvested; crop(s) harvested; estimated and actual quantity harvested, estimated and actual uses of harvests.

**Usage Data**

We collect usage data (i.e., general statistics about users, traffic patterns, and how users respond to various site features) to improve the quality of services we provide to you. This type of data includes: when you log in to Grow, pages you request, how long you visit the site for, how you interact with the app, and technical details about your device (e.g., browser, screen type, and processor). This data will either be associated with your Grow username (if you are logged into the app) or your IP address (if you are not logged in). We may use software such as Google Analytics to collect and analyze usage data, but in these cases, all personal information will be anonymized.  

**How do we use data?**

There are three primary ways that we use your data:

- To improve the services we provide you with: As described above, we use your usage data (i.e., general information about how you interact with the Grow platform) to improve the Grow platform and the services it provides.

- To generate insights about the financial, environmental, and social benefits or impacts of your management decisions: The Grow platform uses the management data that you enter into the app (see “Farm management information” section above for a full list), along with built-in algorithms and some public data (e.g., local weather station information, crop coefficients, crop and fertilizer nutrient content, species occurrence data, and topographic data) to generate insights about financial, environmental, and social benefits/impacts of your management decisions.

- To conduct non-commercial academic research on sustainable food systems: Along with our academic collaborators, we will use your anonymized farm management data (see “Farm management information” section above for a full list) to conduct agronomic, ecological, and food-systems based academic research. Some of this research will be conducted by students as part of their graduate and undergraduate degrees. 

- We will rigorously evaluate every project proposal to ensure that your data is used effectively to advance knowledge on sustainable food systems, help farmers make sustainable management decisions, and impact public policy to benefit farmers. We will keep you in the loop on research projects through email (unless you would prefer to opt out), and you can always reach out to us to learn more about the research that your data is helping to make possible.

**What do we share?**

We will only share your data with third parties if it is both anonymized (i.e., contains no personal information) and necessary to accomplish our research goals or validate scientific findings. Specifically, we may share anonymized data at some point in the future with other researchers for non-commercial academic research purposes. Any third-party academic researchers who request use of Grow data will undergo internal review, and will be assessed under our existing ethics and security standards. Due to publishing standards for scientific reproducibility, anonymized data that is used for academic research may be served on public repositories. Copies of non-public releases of anonymized data can be shared with academic researchers for non-commercial research purposes, under time-limited and confidential single-use licenses. If an academic research use includes the use of photos uploaded to Grow, any identifiable features that disclose personal information (e.g., faces of people) will be blurred out of the photos before they are shared. We do not share any personal information to third party analytics services, such as Google Analytics. Through our security protocols, we safeguard the vulnerability of personal information within the Grow website, and we use IP anonymization protocols to prevent identification and geolocation by third parties.

Access to the Grow database is limited to members of the Grow team who have undergone ethics training (Tri-Council Policy Statement: Ethical Conduct for Research Involving Humans, TCPS2), and have signed confidentiality agreements. However, we cannot guarantee that data transmitted over the internet will always be secure. As a result, though we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure the security of any information you transmit while using Grow.

**What other potential risks are involved with using Grow?**

While we have made every reasonable effort to ensure our application is secure and provides as accurate as possible information to assist you in managing your farm, we recognize that usage of the Grow carries risks to you and your farming operation, and may contain errors, or inaccuracies of content, and security risks. The risks associated with these include potential loss of production, revenue or profit, inability to use, interruption or delay of services, loss, damage, corruption or recovery of data, or breach of data or system security, which may result from using the Grow Service. we do not accept liability for these risks. If you have any concern and are not able to consent to the possibility of these arising please do not sign the consent form at the end of this page or register to use this product. In the cases of known impending risks (such as known dates of loss of services) we will make every effort to forewarn you as a user so you can take necessary precautions to mitigate the risk (e.g. to back-up your data).

**How long will we retain your data?**

We aim to retain your data indefinitely in the interests of scientific reproducibility, but for a minimum of 5 years.

**What are your rights with respect to your personal information?**

You have the right to know what data we have about you, request a copy of it, update and correct your data, request that we stop collecting your data, request a transfer of your data, or ask questions about any analyses using your data. For any such information or requests, contact data@Grow.org.

If you wish to remove all of your data from the Grow database, you may do so by emailing data@Grow.org with your request.

**What happens if you withdraw consent?**

If you withdraw your consent by emailing data@Grow.org, your account(s) on the Grow platform will be marked as inactive and you will not be able to use the Grow platform. However, your information will not be deleted in the case you would like to return at a later time. You can request that your data be permanently and irrevocably deleted by sending a request to data@Grow.org.
